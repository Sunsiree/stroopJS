Implementation of the [Stroop Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect#Stroop_test) (Stroop, 1935) using Javascript and ProcessingJS. 

## Features

* Utilizes the ProcessingJS library to draw on the canvas
* Four game modes illustrating variations of the stroop task

## Tasks

### Words

Implementation of the original Stroop task described by John Ridley Stroop (1935). The user is randomly presented with the word 'red,' 'blue,' 'green,' or 'purple,' colored with one of these colors. The task is to identify the color of the word and not the word text.

### Fancy Words

Continuing with the theory of increased usage of attentional resources reducing processing speed, Fancy Words swaps out the readable sans serif font for a cursive one. Because the words are presented in a way that makes them more difficult to read, speed and accuracy are expected to drop further.

### Numbers

Variation of the numerical Stroop task (Besner and Coltheart, 1979). The user is presented with the 'one,' 'two,' 'three,' 'four,' or 'five,' printed one to five times. The task is to count the number of words and not the word text.

### Direction

Variation of the spatial Stroop task (Wuhr, 2007). The user is presented with the word 'up,' 'down,' 'left,' or 'right,' located high, low, to the left, or to the right of the screen. The task is to input the direction described by the word.
